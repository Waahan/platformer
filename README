My platforming game( a work in progress title) is ment to be a nice little project using SDL2.
I plan for it to be cross platform and work on window, linux, mac and possibly android or the web.

# Building

To build this game you will need cmake and SDL2, SDL_image, SDL_ttf and SDL_mixer

# License

I plan to license this project under GPL-3. Also I did not write SDL2.
